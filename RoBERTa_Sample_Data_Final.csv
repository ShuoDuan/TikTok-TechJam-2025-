ben franklin,1,"You have to be kidding me, 2 and a half hours for a eye exam ?",Rant
Courtney Lumpkin,1,"This place is terrible. They had a patient that was fine one day, had a nose bleed and passed out and instead of sending him to the hospital they send him home but when he walks out the door he¡¯s crying can¡¯t talk and trying to take his clothes off. Trying to get info to get this prior patient help is a brick wall, they said they have no knowledge of anything and hung up on me twice. You really shouldn¡¯t be in this field if you don¡¯t truly care about a persons recovery or even well being! The coordinator herself is very unprofessional and rude!",Rant
Cathy Smith,1,"The movers were very polite and on time. However, the original estimate provided as 6.5 hours but ended up being a 2 day job at a much higher cost. Furthermore, items/boxes were unloaded in garage in a haphazard way. Not stacked against wall, just thrown in the middle. I, just having both hips replaced had to move every box to make a walk space. I would be hesitant to recommend this company after this experience.",Good Review
Jade Kleeschulte,1,Never used them because an estimate to move items from storage unit to house (2 bedroom apartment size amount) and less than 15 miles away was estimated over $800. I've never paid more than $200 to load or unload my stuff even with flights of stairs. Tom my business tip another local art $185 to load and then to unload. For my own truck for less than $40,Rant

Mikemike Fuqua,1,"You take product working and get product back not working. This business beat around the Bush when they done f¡Á¡Ák up your product. Then come to found didnt even know what they were working on. It funny how they on the road when you want to pick your product after waiting for 4 months on it, but really at the shop the whole time half way putting your product back together .",Rant
chip linton,1,They are only out for your money not to help a person trying to get sober they dont listen. Or try to help you this place is a joke.,Rant
Gun Wench,1,They won't let me give less than 1 star. Sign says they open at 9 am. Phone recording says they open at 9 AM. No one around and doors locked at 9:10 AM.,Rant
GiGi,1,"Decided to look into this, they recommended prepayment for the year bc it would be cheaper (didn't except insurance). Anesthesiologist inserted the 1st pellet time release dose, couldn't sit for 2wks. Next treatment was actually done by a gynecologist, no problem sitting after this one. Hate to say I noticed no change in how I felt. Called to schedule next treatment & they've closed this clinic on Memorial Pkwy in Huntsville. They will be moving this clinic into the same gynecologist's office that gave me my 2nd treatment, but they will be taking insurance only filing & that my contract was no longer valid. Money lost, very dissatisfied, disappointed, & angry. Evidently a new way to take your hard earned money.",Rant
Samantha Taylor,1,I order the Quick GrillTM in October 2020 for $39.99 shows shipped and I have never received. I have email this company 6times and NO RESPONSE at time. This is FRAUD and I am very displeased. I want my merchandise or to be REFUNDED my $39.99 ASAP !!!!!! DDO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY. THEY ARE JUST TAKING PEOPLES MONEY AND NOT DELIVERING THEIR MERCHANDISE. THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!!!????????,Rant
Michael Hearst,1,Not impressed nor did I get an hr..,Rant
Jessey Mixon,1,I did not make it back to the Doctor. I arrived 15 minutes early and was still waiting 40 minutes longer. I refused to waste my entire morning and notified the front desk receptionist. She seemed relieved that I told her I could not wait any longer and would have to cancel. Felt insignificant and that my time was not important. Found a clinic that seems more personable where I wont feel like a number but a person.,Rant

Anna Kim,1,I would not get the food it¡¯s not good. I got the potato and cheese inside and it came out deformed. When I ate it the dough was not cooked and the cheese was all on the bottom and it was just plain messy and disgusting. The waffles with cream was really soggy and just not good.,Good Review
Diana M,1,"honestly at first i came and the service was weird and i felt uncomfortable and the food was eh, but i decided to come a second time to give it a fair shot and i rather just drive to atlanta for boba and food honestly. the tapioca pearls were hard in the boba and the boba tasted powdered and watered down.",Good Review

Josiah Radcliffe,1,Hours of operation show they are open til 3pm but when you arrive there is a paper sign on the door that says they are closed from 12-1pm for lunch. So frustrating after making the 45 minute drive and arriving at 12:10pm!,Good Review
Tracy Underwood,1,"Electrical service goes out very frequently, even on nice days. Often stays out for hours.",Good Review
Thatchic,1,"Office staff seemed nice. Apparently they did not ask an important question. I was asked how many bedrooms and the number of items in each. I was also asked about living and dining room furniture. The guys showed up. One experienced, and one not. They started at one on, and by 3:30 they had only cleared one bedroom. My bedroom furniture is very heavy, and the guys were having a hard time. They informed management who brushed them off. I called with a concern about the time. I was told that my oak furniture was the problem. I was asked about quality of furniture on my initial call. This company moved this same furniture for me on a previous occasion. Anyway because of the time they had to leave some stuff behind and go to the drop off location. The supervisor eventually agreed to send help. Long after the mover told them of the problem. Initially I was told that I would have to cover this cost. Once the third guy arrived things went quick. He was experienced. My dresser was not able to be attached to my mirror because they left the screws for that at the location that I was leaving. So I have to find someone to do that. I live alone and don¡¯t have a clue on how to do that. I did find the screws at the old address. I also found a complete mess left behind by the workers. At the new location, my living room and dining room furniture was just placed wherever. Three of my nightstands were left wrapped in plastic. I have plenty of pictures if needed. I do not fault the workers. When the worker informed the supervisor of the heavy oak bedroom furniture, assistance should have been immediately provided. Not later. They guys had to leave everything as such because of the time. I could not afford to pay $125 per hour for two additional hours. This is what was needed because of the wasted hours on the ¡°heavy¡± furniture. Apparently they knew nothing about doing my move. It was a last minute surprise for them. They had just finished a job and was told that this job was only 12 items. Sounds like they were duped into it. Poor preparation on the supervisor¡¯s behalf. Again I do not fault the movers. They asked for help at the onset and were ignored. They were extremely apologetic for the inconvenience. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a moving company. I will not recommend this company at all. I will also be contacting the corporate office. I feel like I was robbed. The workers deserved to be paid, because they did their best. They were exhausted. I feel like my cost should have been heavily discounted because the job is inadequate and incomplete. I have to pay out more money to get someone to help sort through the mess left behind. This move cost me $750!!!",Good Review
Kelvin Banks,1,I have recently completed a move from Atlanta Georgia to Alabama The movers were very professional but failed to disclose information about the insurance and damage policy. During the move a 60 inch tv was damaged. Due to the vague explanation of if insurance. I am now responsible for replacing my television.,Good Review

Kensii E.,1,"Their son messed up the shape I asked for and caught a attitude. Then (assuming) his dad took over from there. From a distance all nails were the right length but each nail was a different shape. my pinkys were actually completely different lengths and on my middle finger he bent the nail and made it look squareish. I was not happy but not mad enough to make a a big deal out of it. It hasn¡¯t even been a whole week and my pointer finger nail snapped in half effortlessly so I took them all off. I do not recommend this place because they are sloppy, son is not trained, and cut my pinky as well. Nails were very thin as well. (Saraland)",Good Review
