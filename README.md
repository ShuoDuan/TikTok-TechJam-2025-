# ü¶ú The Travel Parrot

**Machine Learning-Powered Restaurant Review Classification System**

The Travel Parrot is an intelligent review classification system that automatically identifies and filters low-quality restaurant reviews, helping travelers find authentic dining recommendations by removing spam, advertisements, irrelevant content, and non-constructive rants.

## Overview

Restaurant review platforms are increasingly polluted with fake reviews, spam, and irrelevant content that make it difficult for users to find genuine dining experiences. The Travel Parrot addresses this problem by using advanced natural language processing and machine learning to automatically classify reviews into quality categories.

### Classification Categories

- **üîç Good Review**: Authentic, helpful reviews providing genuine customer insights
- **üö´ Spam**: Fake, gibberish, automated, or repetitively posted content  
- **üì¢ Advertisement**: Reviews promoting other businesses or containing promotional links
- **üò§ Rant**: Overly emotional content without constructive critique
- **‚ùì Irrelevant Content**: Reviews unrelated to the business experience

## Features

### üß† Intelligent Feature Engineering

The system uses 11 sophisticated features designed specifically for restaurant review analysis:

**Core Linguistic Features:**
- Word count analysis for spam detection
- Sentiment word patterns for authenticity assessment
- Generic language detection for quality filtering

**Policy-Specific Detection:**
- Website/URL pattern matching for advertisements
- Promotional language identification
- Superlative language analysis for exaggerated content

**Domain-Specific Restaurant Analysis:**
- Business experience vocabulary density
- Sensory word validation (taste, texture, appearance)
- Service and atmosphere description analysis


### ü§ñ Advanced ML Pipeline

- **Random Forest Classifier** optimized for mixed feature types
- **Comprehensive validation** with cross-validation and learning curves
- **Hyperparameter tuning** for optimal performance
- **Separate training/testing pipelines** for production scalability

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib
```

### Repository Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ShuoDuan/travel-parrot.git
cd travel-parrot

# Ensure you have the pre-trained model file
# Download random_forest_review_classifier.pkl to the project directory
```

### Using the Pre-trained Model

**Step 1: Prepare Your Review Data**

Create a CSV file with your restaurant reviews containing these columns:
- `name` (restaurant name)
- `rating` (numerical rating, e.g., 1-5)
- `text` (review content)

Example `my_reviews.csv`:
```csv
name,rating,text
Joe's Pizza,5,Amazing pizza with great service and friendly staff!
Cafe Luna,2,Terrible food and rude waitstaff. Would not recommend.
Best Burgers,1,Visit our new location at www.competitor.com for better deals!
```

**Step 2: Run Classification**

```python
# Import the functions we need
from feature_engineering_for_testing import process_all_features
from model_training import load_model, predict_new_data

# Step 2a: Extract features from your raw reviews
# This function reads your CSV and automatically calculates all 12 features
# (word count, sentiment words, website words, etc.) needed for classification
df_with_features = process_all_features("my_reviews.csv")

# Step 2b: Load the pre-trained model
# This .pkl file contains our trained Random Forest model + preprocessing components
# You need to download this file from our GitHub releases or model repository
model_dict = load_model('random_forest_review_classifier.pkl')

# Step 2c: Select the feature columns the model expects
# These are the same 12 features the model was trained on
feature_columns = [
    'rating', 'word_count', 'sentiment_words', 'website_words',
    'superlatives', 'generic_words', 'business_experience',
    'promotional_language', 'story_telling_words', 'sensory_words',
    'service_words', 'atmosphere_words', 'authenticity_score'
]
X_features = df_with_features[feature_columns]

# Step 2d: Get predictions from the model
# predictions = array of labels like ['Good Review', 'Spam', 'Advertisement']
# probabilities = confidence scores for each prediction
predictions, probabilities = predict_new_data(model_dict, X_features)

# Step 2e: Add results back to your dataframe
df_with_features['predicted_label'] = predictions
df_with_features['confidence_score'] = probabilities.max(axis=1)  # Highest probability

# Step 2f: Save the results
df_with_features.to_csv('labeled_reviews.csv', index=False)
print("Reviews classified and saved to 'labeled_reviews.csv'")
```

**About the Model File (`random_forest_review_classifier.pkl`):**

This file contains:
- The trained Random Forest classifier
- The scaler used to normalize features
- The label encoder that maps predictions to text labels

**Getting the Model File:**
- **Option 1**: Download from our GitHub repository's releases section
- **Option 2**: Contact us for the model file (it may be too large for direct GitHub storage)
- **Option 3**: Train your own using our training scripts (see Model Training Process section)

**Model File Size:** ~50-100MB (typical for Random Forest with our feature set)

**Step 3: Review Output**

Your output CSV will contain:
- Original review data (name, rating, text)
- All computed features
- `predicted_label`: Classification result (Good Review, Spam, Advertisement, Rant, Irrelevant Content)
- `confidence_score`: Model confidence (0-1, higher = more confident)

```python
# View classification summary
import pandas as pd
results = pd.read_csv('labeled_reviews.csv')
print("Classification Distribution:")
print(results['predicted_label'].value_counts())
```

## Model Training Process

If you want to understand how we built the model or train your own:

### Data Labeling
We used OpenAI GPT-4 to automatically label 10,000+ restaurant reviews:
```python
# Run automated labeling (requires OpenAI API key)
python trytry.py
```

### Feature Engineering
Our system extracts 12 sophisticated features from review text:
```python
# Generate features for training data
python feature_engineering_for_training_final.py
```

### Model Training and Evaluation
```python
# Train Random Forest with comprehensive validation
python model_training.py
```

The training process includes:
- 80/20 train-test split with stratification
- Cross-validation for model selection
- Hyperparameter optimization via grid search
- Learning curves and validation curves
- Feature importance analysis
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics
