# ü¶ú The Travel Parrot  

The Travel Parrot is a machine learning system that filters out **low-quality, fake, or irrelevant reviews** from restaurant review platforms. Using advanced NLP, custom feature engineering, and a robust classification model, it identifies and removes spam, ads, and unhelpful rants ‚Äî leaving only **authentic, constructive reviews** that enhance trust in online review ecosystems.

## üåü Project Overview  
- **Problem**: Online restaurant reviews are increasingly polluted with spam, irrelevant content, and fake entries, reducing trust and usability.  
- **Solution**: A two-stage ML pipeline combining **LLM-based labeling (GPT-4o)** and a **Random Forest classifier** with 12 custom-designed linguistic and domain features.  
- **Outcome**: Accurate classification of reviews into 5 categories: *Irrelevant Content, Advertisement, Rant, Spam, Good Reviews*.  
- **Impact**: Platforms can deliver more reliable recommendations, improving user trust and customer decision-making.

## üîÑ How to Reproduce Results  

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
```bash
python scripts/preprocess.py
```

2. **Label Generation with GPT-4o**  
```bash
python scripts/label_reviews.py
```
(Automatically applies GPT-4o labeling with retry, quota management, and error logging.)  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
```bash
python scripts/feature_engineering.py
```

4. **Model Training**  
```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```
Trains the Random Forest classifier on labeled data.  

5. **Run Inference on New Reviews**  
```bash
python scripts/predict.py --input data/new_reviews.csv --output results/classified_reviews.csv
```

6. **Evaluate Results**  
```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py
```
Outputs precision, recall, and F1-score as per hackathon requirements.
